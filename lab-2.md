Lab 2
=====

**Do this:** Open a github "issue" called something like "lab 2" which you and I
can use to discuss and track your progress on completion of this lab. I'll have
you post weekly updates until you've completed the lab.


## Practice Midterms from ugrad Business Analytics class

I posted my ugrad business analytics class material to github. It includes slides, reading
assignments, and midterm topics guides.
* [website here](https://deargle-classes.github.io/business-analytics/)
* [repo here](https://github.com/deargle-classes/business-analytics)

Take the two midterm exams that I posted to canvas that I gave when I taught ugrad 
business analytics last year. Treat the exams as closed-note. You can take them as 
many times as you want, you can leave and come back, you'll see the correct answers when you're done. 

My intention in giving these to you is as a self-test of understanding of things from "the book." 
Even if you haven't read the book yet, take the exams. It will set a benchmark for yourself.
I am having you take the midterms as a way to help you know some of the things
that I think a b-school data analyst graduate should know.

**Deliverable:** Take the exams as many times as you need. The goal is for you to "do well"
on the exams. "Doing well" means understanding the concepts (not just memorizing the answers).
When it makes sense to do so, keep track of things you feel you're weak on.


## "The Book"

By the end of the week in which this lab is assigned, complete having skimmed through the entire
book at least once. Take notes on what you feel you're especially weak on, and on what you'd like
to talk more about.

**Deliverable:** Report when you have completed skimming through the entire book. Report some thing(s)
you'd like to talk about in our next class session.


## "Get a job"

By the middle of the week, identify at least three companies to which you could theoretically apply.
By the end of the week, have applied to at least one of those jobs. For your health.

**Deliverable:** A brief report on your experiences.
