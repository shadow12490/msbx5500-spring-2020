Dave soliloquied about think-aloud protocol and rubber duck programming for
working through tough problems and writing and debugging code.

We attempted a collaborative job search but got depressed, jaded, and overly
cynical after reading the first promoted posting on linkedin under "data scientist."
Filtering the listings by experience level was somewhat helpful. Collected various
technologies that we may add to our portfolios in order to signal intelligence and
with-it-ism.

We played a bit with github, and had the students join the class "repo." Github Teams is
better than a shared private repo, because collaborators on private repos by default
all have push access to the repo, and I do not trust my students to not unintentionally
or otherwise wreck the class repo. Github Teams allows more granular access permissions.

Will meet again this week to discuss invidiual goals and progress with and for job applications,
and also to discuss potential side projects.

Triscuits were popular but seriously who eats barbeque chips at 9am. Next
time will be triscuits, apples, and cheese sticks.

Interviews with each student during office hours. Goal was to check in with each student
about their job-search status, desires, etc. Students exhorted to have at least three-ish
actual job postings in mind, and to build out portfolio for those jobs. Dave attempted
to light a fire under proverbial students to get them to start applying _now_.

Spent first part of class comparing notes and strategizing about job applications. Business
value / costs of false positives versus false negatives were pondered, including resumes and early rounds 
of interviews as "signaling" events. 

Second half was dedicated to sundry questions about using git and setting up a personal website using github pages,
jekyll, etc. A few questions related to the Kaggle machine learning questions were addressed.

Business analytics class midterms were posted, and students were assigned to take both. Open-notes, open feedback.
I told the students that I had them take the midterms the exams as a way to help them know some of the things
that I think a b-school data analyst graduate should know.

We talked through a Hunter Douglas case project that the students have in one of their other classes. Used it as
an example of CRISP-DM -- articulating the business question, understanding the data, understanding what modeling
can do (make predictions on what?). Discussion had good participation.

Stomach illness went around this week, beginning with Saturday previous. My individually-wrapped cheese sticks 
were wrongly accused.

Between class sessions, one student practiced submitting pull requests to the class repo to fix lab documentation. Will
formally build pull requests into the class requirements in the future. It's important github practice.

Quick job update. Several career fairs this week, and campus visits from recruiters. Answered a few jekyll github pages
questions related to using my theme which I broke off from my site. 

Began interactive-lecture-ing at students about the all-encompassing review of all things Business Analytics. 
Notes [here](/business-analytics-crash-course-2-3-2020.md).

During office hours, began to talk about confusion matrices, ROC curves with their p-coin baselines, TPR vs FPR vs PPV,
and how those relate to AUC. Class priors, class imbalances and strategies for handling the same. Need to cover this again
next Monday.

Had intended to start with the kaggle credit card fraud dataset, but did not get to it. Want to start by next class. Also
want to give them quick ways to put up markdown versions of their R or python analyses / write-ups. Gists, .md, the like.
