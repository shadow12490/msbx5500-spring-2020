# General Agenda for discussion-based class.

I use the following framework for my classes.

1. **Share and counsel together.** Begin by inviting students to share recent analytics-related experiences and ask questions related to analytics.
1. **Learn together.** Invite students to discuss one or more of the ideas from the recent labs.
1. **Practice.** Hands-on doing of analytics, whether it be evaluation of models on whiteboard, or writing code, etc.
